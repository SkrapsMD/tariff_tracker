""" 
Now we have countries, their imports, and their prevailing tariff rates (WIP). Now we need to 
Find the change in the tariff rates as a function, and then we can calculate the change in the price index. 
For now, let's also take the data for the expenditure shares from Baslandze and Fuchs (2025).

    Calculate the estimated price effects from tariff changes using country‚Äêspecific
    old tariffs given in the "tariff_rate" column.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing at least the following columns:
          - 'country': Name or code of the country.
          - 'tariff_rate': The current (old) tariff rate for the country.
          - 'trade_openness_wt_expShare_wt': A factor used in the price change calculation.
    new_tariffs : dict
        A dictionary mapping country names (or codes) to the new tariff rate.
        For example: {'USA': 0.08, 'Canada': 0.1}. THESE ARE CHANGES, NOT THE NEW TARIFF RATE.
    pass_through : float
        The pass-through rate applied in the calculation.
    
    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame with columns 'country' and 'price_effect' showing the estimated
        price change for each country with a new tariff.
